## Introduction

Goal: Given a set of odorants and their activiation pattern for specific glomeruli of the drosophila antenna lobe. Find a minimal subset of odorants, such that each glomeruli can be distinguished by the olfactory spectrum induced by that subset.


## Installation

* Install required packages (via pip or easy_install):
    * Flask==0.10.1
    * matplotlib==1.3.1
    * numpy==1.8.0
    * scipy==0.13.1

* If you intend to use Gurobi to solve the optimization problem, you need to download and install Gurobi first (http://gurobi.com).
    * this requires a license (which are free for academical use)

* Checkout this repository (https://github.com/marcusschroeder/olfactory)

* Run the the testfile test.py

## Example 1: Run backward elimination on Hallem data-set

## Example 2: Run Gurobi on Hallem data-set
